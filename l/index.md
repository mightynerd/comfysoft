## Browsers

### Firefox
Very customizable but slower than Chromium, especially with many tabs and
extentions. Not bound to Google but you'll have to trust Mozilla in order
to use their synchronization feature. Falls often behind when it comes
to newer technologies which can be solved by running the Nighlty builds
at the expence of lower stability.

### Chromium
The free and open source base Google Chrome is built upon. Very fast with many extentions altough not as customizable as Firefox. Not bound to Google as mutch as Chrome (which probably is the main reason people run Chromium) and it also lacks some components
such as auto update, built-in Adobe Flash or support for non-free media codecs,
some of which can be installed separatly.

## Editors

### Atom
Free and open source using the Electron GUI framework with a modern look and build-in git support. Very customizable with themes and plug-ins which can be installed from within the editor.

### Vim

## Video Players

### MPV
Free and open source fork of mplayer and MPlayer focused on CLI and high quality output. It is fully controllable using a keyboard but offers an optional and minimalistic OSC. Very customizable (including the OSC) through configuration files and LUA scripts. Supports playback from various streaming websites such as YouTube through youtube-dl and can be used as an transcoder.
