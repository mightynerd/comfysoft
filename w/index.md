## Web Browsers

### Firefox
Very customizable but slower than Chromium, especially with many tabs and
extentions. Not bound to Google but you'll have to trust Mozilla in order
to use their synchronization feature. Falls often behind when it comes
to newer technologies which can be solved by running the Nighlty builds
at the expence of lower stability.

### Chromium
The free and open source base Google Chrome is built upon. Very fast with many extentions altough not as customizable as Firefox. Not bound to Google as mutch as Chrome (which probably is the main reason people run Chromium) and it also lacks some components
such as auto update, built-in Adobe Flash or support for non-free media codecs,
some of which can be installed separatly.

## Text Editors

### Atom
Free and open source using the Electron GUI framework with a modern look and
build-in git support. Very customizable with themes and plug-ins which can be installed from within the editor.

### Notepad++
Free and open source written in C++ which focuses on performance and small program
size. It is therefore very lightweight altough still extensible.

## Video Players

### MPC-HC
Free and open source lightweight with a simple classic interface. Has a basic
container and codec support out of the box and can be extended using directshow
filters. Built-in hardware accelerated playback. Often the standard player for
multiple codec packs such as CCCP or K-Lite which can be downloaded to extend
it's format support to almost any existing format.

### MPV
Free and open source fork of mplayer and MPlayer focused on CLI and high quality
output. It is fully controllable using a keyboard but offers an optional and
minimalistic OSC. Very customizable (including the OSC) through configuration
files and LUA scripts. Supports playback from various streaming websites
such as YouTube through youtube-dl and can be used as an transcoder.

## Audio Players

### Foobar2000
Freeware, fully customizable and full of features for managing your music
library including tagging and transcoding audio files. Offers a fully modular
